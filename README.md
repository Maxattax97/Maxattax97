# Greetings 🖖

Alright, time to load up my `README.md` with a boatlod of emoji's like every other BASIC programmer out there 💁. Just kidding, let's show at least a _little_ class 🎩.

Here are my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Maxattax97/miscellaneous) if you're looking for them. It's probably the single repo I touch most. I use the h\*ck out of neovim, tmux, bspwm, weechat, and zsh if that's your thing (let's face it, I'm the average Arch user you'll find on on IRC). Oh and here's [my website](https://maxocull.com/), sometimes I post techy stuff.
